# Hospital-Project
This project was made with OOP in Java as part of the OOP course in university to build a hospital's Information System.
The project is an information system that offers a solution to manage a hospital's staff, patients, departments and subdepartments, while documenting diseases and producing reports concerning a patien's treatment in order to help with the large volume of patients during the covid era.
The Project showcases the use of interfaces, data structures, exceptions, inheritence, singelton, as well as different methods that perform different tasks such as: returning all patiens whose condition is set as bad, finding which nurse treated the most patients, returning a linkedList containing all patients that suffer from difficulty breathing and more.
